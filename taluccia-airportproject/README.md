# Airports in the United States (Lab 3)

**Project Description:**

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with interactive map design. The map developed here includes airports through the United States labeled. Their location is labeled with an airplane icon that is color coded to differentiate between airports with air traffic control towers and those without. The states are color coded to show differences in airport density between states. Additional functions include:

- Clickable marker with Airport Name when the user clicks the airport icon
- Legend to inform the user what the different colored airplanes mean and the colors for the states 
- Scale Bar, Credit useful information for the user
- Graticules displayed to show latitude and longitude
